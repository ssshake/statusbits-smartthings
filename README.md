## SmartThings Projects

This repository contains applications (SmartApps) and custom device types I
have written for the [SmartThings](http://fbuy.me/bb9pe) home
automation system.

Currently these include:

* __Dim and Dimmer__ - create lighting scenes
* __Pollster__ - a SmartThings polling daemon
* __VirtualThings__ - SmartThings virtual devices
